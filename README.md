This mobile application is a playlist tracker and song review tool, developed for users who want a simple and organized way to document songs they enjoy along with personal notes. It allows users to input essential song details including the Song Title, Artist Name, a Rating (1–5), and Comments. The interface is designed to be intuitive, with clear input fields and buttons to help users add entries or view their complete playlist. To enhance user experience, the app incorporates modern UI elements like Material Snackbars for visual confirmations and includes validation to ensure all fields are properly filled before proceeding.

The application maintains a global list of song entries, which persists throughout the app session, allowing users to build and review a custom collection. Once songs are added, users can navigate to a detailed view screen that displays the playlist in a well-structured table format. Each row includes the song’s title, artist, rating, and the user's personal comments, helping users keep track of why a song is meaningful or memorable to them. Additionally, users are offered the ability to undo entries immediately after adding them, preventing accidental submissions.

To improve usability, the app includes convenience features such as a "Show Playlist" button for quick navigation and a "Go Back" option to continue editing or adding more songs. A thoughtful addition is the "Exit App" button, which prompts the user with a confirmation dialog before closing the application, preventing unintentional exits. Overall, this app combines functional design and user-friendly interaction to create a smooth experience for music lovers who want to build and manage a personal playlist or review list in a simple yet effective way
